# Hyacinth

Hyacinth is a hybrid imperative-functional programming language with a static, nominal type system. Hyacinth is compiled to a custom bytecode format, and run by the Hyacinth bytecode VM. The design of Hyacinth is inspired by several languages including Typescipt, Haskell, and C#.

Hyacinth is an in-progress personal project of Robin Gieseking. Hyacinth is not ready or intended for any production use, and may have backwards-incompatible changes at any time. This project is mostly a vehicle for me to learn more about compilers and programming language theory. But, if you are interested in Hyacinth, feel free to check it out and play around with it a little.

For an installation guide and more information about the language, check out the [Hyacinth docs](https://avian-lovelace.github.io/hyacinth/).
